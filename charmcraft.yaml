summary: eBPF-based continuous profiling agent.
description: |
  Parca Agent is an always-on sampling profiler that uses eBPF to capture raw profiling data with
  very low overhead. It observes user-space and kernel-space stacktraces 19 times per second and
  builds pprof formatted profiles from the extracted data. Read more details in the design
  documentation.

  The collected data can be viewed locally via HTTP endpoints and then be configured to be sent to
  a Parca server to be queried and analysed over time.
